<center><h2>History of Linux</h2></center>
The history of Linux can be traced back to the early days of UNIX, which was developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1969. UNIX was a proprietary operating system, but it was later rewritten in C, making it more portable and widely used.

In the 1980s, Richard Stallman, a software developer, started the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, which aimed to create a free software version of UNIX. Stallman developed the GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license, and the GNU kernel, called Hurd, which was never completed.

In 1991, <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong>, a computer science student, was frustrated with the limitations of UNIX and decided to create his own operating system that would be open-source. He created a kernel called Linux and released it to the public. The Linux kernel was designed to be compatible with the existing GNU tools and utilities, and it quickly gained popularity among developers and users.

Over time, various Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Red Hat, have been developed, each with its own unique features and tools. Linux has grown from a student's project to become one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, powering everything from supercomputers to smartphones. It's now commonly used by developers, businesses, governments, and individuals due to its stability, security, and flexibility.
