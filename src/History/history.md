<center><h2>History of Linux</h2></center>
To learn about how Linux came to be, letâ€™s go back to the beginning to 1969 where Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.
<br/>
A decade or so later, Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license, was also created as a result of this.
 However, one thing that all these UNIX like-systems had in common was the lack of a unified kernel.
<br/><br/>
Linux is an operating system or a kernel which came as an idea in the mind of <strong> Linus Torvalds </strong> when he was a computer science student. He used to work on the UNIX which was a proprietary software, and thought that it needed improvements. But UNIX designers regected his idea. <br/>
So he came up with launching an OS which will be receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users. Or in other words an OS that will be Open Source.
He created a Kernel named Linux and lauched it in 1991.


Today Linux is a very fast growing OS. It is everywhere in our phones, laptops, PCs, cars and even in refrigerators. It is very much famous among developers and normal computer users.
