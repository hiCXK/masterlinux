<center><h1>Linux is Everywhere</h1></center>

From your kitchen to the reaches of outer space, Linux is truly everywhere. This is because of portablity, it supports a wide range of computer architectures.

## In Super Computers
20 years back, most of the supercomputers ran Unix. But eventually, Linux took the lead and become the preferred choice of operating system for the supercomputers.
As per the latest report from Top 500, Linux now runs on all the fastest 500 supercomputers in the world.

Supercomputers are specific devices built for specific purposes. This requires a custom operating system optimized for those specific needs.
Unix, being a closed source and propriety operating system, is an expensive deal when it comes to customization. Linux, on the other hand, is free and easier to customize. Engineering teams can easily customize a Linux-based operating system for each of the supercomputers.

## Space Programs
Linux is not only on earth but also on space, and even on Mars.
From storing data sent down from satellites and telescopes, to crunching that data for research institutions and the greater public to use, NASA relies heavily on Linux.
NASAâ€™s use of Linux and open-source software is testament to the versatility and adaptability of the kernel and its related software ecosystem.
