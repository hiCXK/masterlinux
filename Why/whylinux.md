<center><h2>Why Linux?</h2></center>

### Open Source
Linux is open-source software. This means that the source code of the Linux project is available to the general public under the GPL license. Anyone can download the source code of Linux for free, modify the code for their own use, and even create their own version of Linux and release that themselves. The developer community benefits from this as its members have the freedom to view and modify the source code, which is not the case with proprietary software, which they can only use.

Open Source is the most important feature of Linux. Linus Torvalds's idea was launching an OS which will be receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users. Or in other words an OS that will be Open Source.
