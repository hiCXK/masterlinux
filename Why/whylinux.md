<center><h1>Why Linux?</h1></center>

## Open Source
Linux is open-source software. This means that the source code of the Linux project is available to the general public under the GPL license. Anyone can download the source code of Linux for free, modify the code for their own use, and even create their own version of Linux and release that themselves. The developer community benefits from this as its members have the freedom to view and modify the source code, which is not the case with proprietary software, which they can only use.

Open Source is the most important feature of Linux. Linus Torvalds's idea was launching an OS which will be receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users. Or in other words an OS that will be Open Source.

## Portable
Linux is a portable operating system that supports a wide range of computer architectures. That is the reason you can find Linux everywhere, from your car to your watch.

Portability refers to how easily code can move from one system architecture to another. We know that Linux is portable because it has already been ported to various systems. But this portability did not occur overnight—it requires diligence and a constant eye toward writing portable code.

Linux is portable because it was created with portability in mind. While creating it, Linus thought it was important and cool, for Linux to be supported on the largest possible variety of processors. That’s why most older intel CPU processors are still supported.

You might be really surprised about how easy is to use one Linux distros on various computers without much effort.
Linux distros come bundled with the drivers required to run almost every hardware. This allows you to use your installed Linux distro on almost any computer. And if hardware like GPU is not being supported, then you can fix that by installing open-source drivers for that respective GPU.


## Secure
Linux systems are rarely infected by malware such as viruses, worms etc, thereby making it as a very secure OS. As a normal user, we will never come across a situation where Antivirus software is been sold for Linux. This means, Linux is inherently secure and there are many reasons associated with it. Let us look into the key reasons that describes why is linux more secure than other operating systems.

As Linux is Open Source, the code is developed and maintained by set of highly passionate individuals who is often called as “community”. Since the beginning of Linux, its creator Linus Torvalds has been a strong supporter of getting more “eye-balls” looking into the code. This means the more people see the code and review or test it, the quality improves. Even though this concept applies to all open source software development, for Linux it is followed very religiously.
