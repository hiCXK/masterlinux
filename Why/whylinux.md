<center><h1>Why Linux?</h1></center>

## Open Source
Linux is open-source software. This means that the source code of the Linux project is available to the general public under the GPL license. Anyone can download the source code of Linux for free, modify the code for their own use, and even create their own version of Linux and release that themselves. The developer community benefits from this as its members have the freedom to view and modify the source code, which is not the case with proprietary software, which they can only use.

Open Source is the most important feature of Linux. Linus Torvalds's idea was launching an OS which will be receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users. Or in other words an OS that will be Open Source.

## Portable
Linux is a portable operating system that supports a wide range of computer architectures. That is the reason you can find Linux everywhere, from your car to your watch.

Portability refers to how easily code can move from one system architecture to another. We know that Linux is portable because it has already been ported to various systems. But this portability did not occur overnight—it requires diligence and a constant eye toward writing portable code.

Linux is portable because it was created with portability in mind. While creating it, Linus thought it was important and cool, for Linux to be supported on the largest possible variety of processors. That’s why most older intel CPU processors are still supported.

You might be really surprised about how easy is to use one Linux distros on various computers without much effort.
Linux distros come bundled with the drivers required to run almost every hardware. This allows you to use your installed Linux distro on almost any computer. And if hardware like GPU is not being supported, then you can fix that by installing open-source drivers for that respective GPU.


## Secure
Linux systems are rarely infected by malware such as viruses, worms etc, thereby making it as a very secure OS. As a normal user, we will never come across a situation where Antivirus software is been sold for Linux. This means, Linux is inherently secure and there are many reasons associated with it. Let us look into the key reasons that describes why is linux more secure than other operating systems.

As Linux is Open Source, the code is developed and maintained by set of highly passionate individuals who is often called as “community”. Since the beginning of Linux, its creator Linus Torvalds has been a strong supporter of getting more “eye-balls” looking into the code. This means the more people see the code and review or test it, the quality improves. Even though this concept applies to all open source software development, for Linux it is followed very religiously.

From its very inception, security has been a cornerstone of the Linux operating system. Each user has to be walled off from others, and a password and user ID are required for an individual to use Linux. Users also have lower automatic access rights, which makes it harder for them to perpetuate the spread of malware by accessing a wide range of files on the computer. The open source format with many different operating environments, system architectures, and components — such as different email clients — also makes it more difficult for malware to sweep through it.

## Developer Friendly
Whether you need to write in C, C++, CSS, Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, or Vala, Linux supports them all. While you may come across some issues at times, in most cases you should have a smooth ride.
Generally speaking, if a programming language isn't limited to a specific operating system, like Visual Basic for Windows, it should work on Linux. But do a proper research first to make sure.
If you do run into support issues, you can usually get your hands on the required packages from Linux's distribution repositories. 

Linux has a lot of great supported apps that are handy for many programmers. While you could just write your code using a simple text file, Linux has some very useful, and time-saving, text editors to make your life a lot easier.
<!-- To Do: Add links to words like Bash script -->
If you need to program something a bit more specific and don't need to care about the language, you can "Bash script" using Linux's commands.

## Customization
Linux is, without a doubt, the most customizable OS on the planet. Unlike the alternatives, where you can customize the desktop experience with a wallpaper and maybe a set of icons on Linux, you can replace the whole desktop environment if it doesn’t look and function as you’d like.
