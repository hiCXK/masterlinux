<h2 id="open-source"><a class="header" href="#open-source">Open Source</a></h2>
<p>Linux is open-source software. This means that the source code of the Linux project is available to the general public under the GPL license. Anyone can download the source code of Linux for free, modify the code for their own use, and even create their own version of Linux and release that themselves. The developer community benefits from this as its members have the freedom to view and modify the source code, which is not the case with proprietary software, which they can only use.</p>
<p>Open Source is the most important feature of Linux. Linus Torvalds's idea was launching an OS which will be receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users. Or in other words an OS that will be Open Source.</p>
<h2 id="portable"><a class="header" href="#portable">Portable</a></h2>
<p>Linux is a portable operating system that supports a wide range of computer architectures. That is the reason you can find Linux everywhere, from your car to your watch.</p>
<p>Portability refers to how easily code can move from one system architecture to another. We know that Linux is portable because it has already been ported to various systems. But this portability did not occur overnight—it requires diligence and a constant eye toward writing portable code.</p>
<p>Linux is portable because it was created with portability in mind. While creating it, Linus thought it was important and cool, for Linux to be supported on the largest possible variety of processors. That’s why most older intel CPU processors are still supported.</p>
<p>You might be really surprised about how easy is to use one Linux distros on various computers without much effort.
Linux distros come bundled with the drivers required to run almost every hardware. This allows you to use your installed Linux distro on almost any computer. And if hardware like GPU is not being supported, then you can fix that by installing open-source drivers for that respective GPU.</p>
<h2 id="secure"><a class="header" href="#secure">Secure</a></h2>
<p>Linux systems are rarely infected by malware such as viruses, worms etc, thereby making it as a very secure OS. As a normal user, we will never come across a situation where Antivirus software is been sold for Linux. This means, Linux is inherently secure and there are many reasons associated with it. Let us look into the key reasons that describes why is linux more secure than other operating systems.</p>
<p>As Linux is Open Source, the code is developed and maintained by set of highly passionate individuals who is often called as “community”. Since the beginning of Linux, its creator Linus Torvalds has been a strong supporter of getting more “eye-balls” looking into the code. This means the more people see the code and review or test it, the quality improves. Even though this concept applies to all open source software development, for Linux it is followed very religiously.</p>
<p>From its very inception, security has been a cornerstone of the Linux operating system. Each user has to be walled off from others, and a password and user ID are required for an individual to use Linux. Users also have lower automatic access rights, which makes it harder for them to perpetuate the spread of malware by accessing a wide range of files on the computer. The open source format with many different operating environments, system architectures, and components — such as different email clients — also makes it more difficult for malware to sweep through it.</p>
<h2 id="developer-friendly"><a class="header" href="#developer-friendly">Developer Friendly</a></h2>
<p>Whether you need to write in C, C++, CSS, Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, or Vala, Linux supports them all. While you may come across some issues at times, in most cases you should have a smooth ride.
Generally speaking, if a programming language isn't limited to a specific operating system, like Visual Basic for Windows, it should work on Linux. But do a proper research first to make sure.
If you do run into support issues, you can usually get your hands on the required packages from Linux's distribution repositories. </p>
<p>Linux has a lot of great supported apps that are handy for many programmers. While you could just write your code using a simple text file, Linux has some very useful, and time-saving, text editors to make your life a lot easier.</p>
<!-- To Do: Add links to words like Bash script -->
<p>If you need to program something a bit more specific and don't need to care about the language, you can &quot;Bash script&quot; using Linux's commands.</p>
<h2 id="customization"><a class="header" href="#customization">Customization</a></h2>
<p>Linux is, without a doubt, the most customizable OS on the planet. Unlike the alternatives, where you can customize the desktop experience with a wallpaper and maybe a set of icons on Linux, you can replace the whole desktop environment if it doesn’t look and function as you’d like. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><center><h2 id="history-of-linux"><a class="header" href="#history-of-linux">History of Linux</a></h2></center>
To learn about how Linux came to be, let’s go back to the beginning to 1969 where Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.
<br/>
A decade or so later, Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license, was also created as a result of this.
 However, one thing that all these UNIX like-systems had in common was the lack of a unified kernel.
<br/><br/>
Linux is an operating system or a kernel which came as an idea in the mind of <strong> Linus Torvalds </strong> when he was a computer science student. He used to work on the UNIX which was a proprietary software, and thought that it needed improvements. But UNIX designers regected his idea. <br/>
So he came up with launching an OS which will be receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users. Or in other words an OS that will be Open Source.
He created a Kernel named Linux and lauched it in 1991.
<p>Today Linux is a very fast growing OS. It is everywhere in our phones, laptops, PCs, cars and even in refrigerators. It is very much famous among developers and normal computer users.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><center><h1 id="linux-is-everywhere"><a class="header" href="#linux-is-everywhere">Linux is Everywhere</a></h1></center>
<p>From your kitchen to the reaches of outer space, Linux is truly everywhere. This is because of portablity, it supports a wide range of computer architectures.</p>
<h2 id="in-super-computers"><a class="header" href="#in-super-computers">In Super Computers</a></h2>
<p>20 years back, most of the supercomputers ran Unix. But eventually, Linux took the lead and become the preferred choice of operating system for the supercomputers.
As per the latest report from Top 500, Linux now runs on all the fastest 500 supercomputers in the world.</p>
<p>Supercomputers are specific devices built for specific purposes. This requires a custom operating system optimized for those specific needs.
Unix, being a closed source and propriety operating system, is an expensive deal when it comes to customization. Linux, on the other hand, is free and easier to customize. Engineering teams can easily customize a Linux-based operating system for each of the supercomputers.</p>
<h2 id="space-programs"><a class="header" href="#space-programs">Space Programs</a></h2>
<p>Linux is not only on earth but also on space, and even on Mars.
From storing data sent down from satellites and telescopes, to crunching that data for research institutions and the greater public to use, NASA relies heavily on Linux.
NASA’s use of Linux and open-source software is testament to the versatility and adaptability of the kernel and its related software ecosystem.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 align="center"><b>Linux Distributions</b></h1>
An operating system consists of an underlying kernel, applications, and often a graphical user interface. Linux is the kernel, and all operating systems that use it are called "Linux distributions." The term "distribution" comes from the process of sharing Linux-based OSes with other users, also known as "distributing" since the kernel and the OS are generally free.
<p>Linux is Open Source and licensed under the GNU General Public License, which gives freedom to built Operating Systems on it.
Many people have their set of requirements from an OS. Tech savvy people like to customize and tweak existing desktops. Thats why there are thoudands of Linux Distros we have.</p>
