You can just <a href="#">Start Here</a> reading.

A book is organized into chapters. Each chapter is a separate page. Chapters can be nested into a hierarchy of sub-chapters. Typically, each chapter will be organized into a series of headings to subdivide a chapter.

# Install and Build
This guide is created using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). mdBook is a utility to create modern online books from Markdown files.

### Build from source using Rust
To build the **mdbook** executable from source, you will first need to install Rust and Cargo. Follow the instructions on the [Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). mdBook currently requires at least Rust version 1.54.

Once you have installed Rust, the following command can be used to build and install mdBook:

```bash
cargo install mdbook
```
This will automatically download mdBook from [crates.io](https://crates.io/), build it, and install it in Cargo's global binary directory (**~/.cargo/bin/** by default).

To uninstall, run the command **cargo uninstall mdbook.**

## Render the book
Once you have the mdbook CLI tool installed, you can use it to create and render a book.
There are several ways to render a book, but one of the easiest methods is to use the serve command, which will build your book and start a local webserver:
```bash
mdbook serve --open
```

### Command Line Tool

The `mdbook` command-line tool is used to create and build books.
After you have [installed](../guide/installation.md) `mdbook`, you can run the `mdbook help` command in your terminal to view the available commands.

This following sections provide in-depth information on the different commands available.

* [`mdbook init <directory>`](init.md) â€” Creates a new book with minimal boilerplate to start with.
* [`mdbook build`](build.md) â€” Renders the book.
* [`mdbook watch`](watch.md) â€” Rebuilds the book any time a source file changes.
* [`mdbook serve`](serve.md) â€” Runs a web server to view the book, and rebuilds on changes.
* [`mdbook test`](test.md) â€” Tests Rust code samples.
* [`mdbook clean`](clean.md) â€” Deletes the rendered output.
* [`mdbook completions`](completions.md) â€” Support for shell auto-completion.
